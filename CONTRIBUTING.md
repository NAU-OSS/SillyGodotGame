Reporting Bugs:

Use the Issue tracker and label the title with "BUG" Like: "BUG: My game blows up when I try to save"

Suggesting Ideas:

Use the Issue tracker and label the title with "IDEA" Like: "IDEA: Lets add proximity voice chat!"

Contributing Code:

1) Make an Issue, either for a BUG or for an IDEA
2) Branch off that issue
3) Do your work, then when you want to commit...
4) Use the keyword "FIX:" for BUGS and "FEAT:" for ideas
5) Make a PR and request a reviwer
6) apply their reviews, then the review will merge the PR, close the issue, and delete the branch
7) Celebrate with beer

Formatting Guidlines:
Rule of Thumb for both above, Be as DESCRIPTIVE as you can -- 
For bugs, offer what lead to the bug, your specs, screen shots, etc etc
For ideas, clearly outline what you are thinking, what technologies you may consider, etc etc
For PRS, offer screenshots on the changes, why you made them, what to keep in mind
